# Sprint 7 IT Academy | Budget Application


## Introduction

Is there something we all want, need, and dream of - but none of us have? Exactly: `money`. 
With this sad and yet relatable idea in mind, the following project aimed to offer a humble application allowing hypothetical users to estimate the price of a website, as well as obtain a desirable response according to the options they chose and their different prices.

As seen above, the final result should track the selected options, clear up any possible doubts regarding the very nature of the services through an information button, offer a final price, allow the user to keep their customized lists safe and sound, and, finally, display them on a right panel after submitting. 

Independently of the apparent simplicity of the project, it allows for interacting more directly with the client as we are taking into account their choices and preferences, and also providing them with tools for a smoother experience, such as: 

- a `search bar`
- buttons `sorting` their saved lists by `date` and `name`
- an `individualized deleting system` for each list created
- the possibility of `clearing` all their saved budgets `at once`
- a `pagination system` focused on making their saved data more accessible
- the possibility of keeping their budget options `saved in the URL.`

By combining all of these elements, we are delivering if not a great tool (note that this is the creator's second React project, so `of course` it's not good `at all`!), at least an intuitive one.

## Style

In order to customize the assignment, I implemented some extra functionalities (the `navbar` or the `pagination system` are two of the most noticeable ones), and then applied `styled-components` and `in-line styles` to each of the individual components. Since these are my very first steps in using React, I divided the project into three main parts:
- A `welcome` page.
- The `main site`, which incorporates both the `services` at the customer's disposal and a `table` displaying their lists.
- An `about` page, just so it would feel more personal and welcoming:

As it's almost a tradition here, the creation of this little app would have been impossible without the inspiration and stunning designs from different indie video games available in `itch.io` (https://itch.io/), a platform that offers a simple way to find, download and distribute humble and yet heartwarming interactive pieces of art.

For instance, `Eternal Home Floristry` or `Dear Substance Of Kin`, both created by `Deconstructeam` (https://www.deconstructeam.com/), illustrated and gave sense to the very essence of the entire project - and they won't steal much time from you. Check them out! And just in case you feel tempted to create a React application by yourself..

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
